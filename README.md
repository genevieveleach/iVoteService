# iVoteService
CS 356 (Object Oriented Programming and Design) Project 1 - iVoteService

In this programming assignment, I built a Java-based simulation tool based the iVote classroom voting tool.

To run, compile and load /src/SimulationDriver.java

In the SimulationDriver, change FILE_READ to false if you want keyboard input, true if file input from "input.txt"

All student votes are randomly generated as a simulation.

Project Finished: Oct 23, 2017
